# Double Ended Queue
This is an implementation of a double ended queue, which is usually referred to by its irregular acronym, deque (pronounced "Deck").  Deques are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contracted on both ends (either its front or its back). The deque interface, `Deque.java`, demonstrates the value of interfaces in Java by allowing the construction of a deque with multiple kinds of data structures, here, linked lists and arrays. To demonstrate usage of a deque, `Palindrome.java` converts strings to deques, and then tests whether or not the string is a palindrome. Included in the ‘tests’ folder is a series of files that demonstrate unit testing methods on the functions `Palindrome.java`.
